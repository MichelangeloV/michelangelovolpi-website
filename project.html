        The past four decades demonstrated that non-neuronal cells, called <b>astrocytes, are emerging as crucial players for brain function and dysfunction</b>. A major obstacle of previous and current initiatives on neurotechnologies is a lack of focus on astrocytes and most of the tools used to probe and sense astrocytes are derived from those developed to study neurons. To go further, the <b>ASTROTECH Consortium</b> &#9472 which combines 11 funding entities and 14 partners in the academia, public research centers and industrial labs, from 9 European and non European countries &#9472 aims at pioneering the field of "Glial Engineering", to develop a consistent range of tools to record, study, and manipulate astrocytes in the healthy and diseased brain. Pursuing this vision, the objective of my PhD project is to develop a <b>mathematical model of neuron-glia-vascular unit (NGVU)</b>, based on <b>biophysical principles of volume transmission in the brain parenchyma</b>. Furthermore, during a training period provided by ASTROTECH within a group of 15 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs), another important part of the project is related to a tight collaboration with industry representatives and the <i>implementation</i> of the model in an <b>open-source simulation platform</b> adopted in the <i>clinical practice</i>. Moreover, in conjunction with biologists and medical doctors,  another key point of the project is to test the NGVU model by <b>brain-wide simulations of epileptic seizures</b> with emphasis on new venues for their diagnosis and treatment.

      <figcaption> Brain cells named for stars seem to play a role in Alzheimer's disease, a new study finds. Here, the star-shaped astrocytes shown in red surround an amyloid plaque (blue) in a mouse's brain. Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's.
