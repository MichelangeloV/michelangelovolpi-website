          <h2>The ASTROTECH Project</h2>
          <p>
          The past four decades demonstrated that non-neuronal cells, called <b>astrocytes, are emerging as crucial players for brain function and dysfunction</b>. A major obstacle of previous and current initiatives on neurotechnologies is a lack of focus on astrocytes and most of the tools used to probe and sense astrocytes are derived from those developed to study neurons. To go further, the <b>ASTROTECH Consortium</b> &#9472 which combines 11 funding entities and 14 partners in the academia, public research centers and industrial labs, from 9 European and non European countries &#9472 aims at pioneering the field of "Glial Engineering", to develop a consistent range of tools to record, study, and manipulate astrocytes in the healthy and diseased brain. Pursuing this vision, the objective of my PhD project is to develop a <b>mathematical model of neuron-glia-vascular unit (NGVU)</b>, based on <b>biophysical principles of volume transmission in the brain parenchyma</b>. Furthermore, during a training period provided by ASTROTECH within a group of 15 early stage researchers, another important part of the project is related to a tight collaboration with industry representatives and the <i>implementation</i> of the model in an <b>open-source simulation platform</b> adopted in the <i>clinical practice</i>. Moreover, in conjunction with biologists and medical doctors,  another key point of the project is to test the NGVU model by <b>brain-wide simulations of epileptic seizures</b> with emphasis on new venues for their diagnosis and treatment.

          <h2>My interests</h2>
          During the last period of my studies I developed a particular interest in mathematical physics topics related to the <b>Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics</b>, as
          <ul>

          </ul>
          and <b>Ising-like models</b>, e.g. Spin-glass models of neural networks which are deeply connected and based on the works of Parisi <i>et al.</i>, <i>inter alia</i> the Replica Symmetry Breaking (RSB), and their mathematization carried out by Talagrand; see:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.10069.pdf" a target ="_blank">Spin-glass models of neural networks - D. J. Amit, H. Gutfreund, and H. Sompolinsky</a></li>
          </ul>
          The choice of a doctoral project in <b>Neuroscience</b> is aimed at combining my mathematical and physical interests with the study of the brain, in particular at the local level of the neuro-glial vascular unit and subsequently at the network level by exploring connectomics. The philosophy behind this work is to seek a bridge between mathematical models deriving from <b>Dynamical Systems</b>, <b>Statistical Mechanics</b>, <b>Neural Networks</b>, numerical solution of <b>PDEs</b>, and the <b>Physiology</b> of the system.
